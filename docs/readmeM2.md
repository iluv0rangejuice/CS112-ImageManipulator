Continuing on from the incompletion of milestone one, I still had small trouble getting the code to work properly; however, milestone two wasn't as difficult to work with--mainly because I've been working with the same code for a while and understand most of the mechanics behind it. But the power outtage deffintaly set me back because I was hoping to get tutoring done. I didn't run into many bumps in this assignment, but the purpose of me going to tutoring was to figure out how to cout  bunny.ppm and convert it back into a int. In my code, I had changed the whole file into and int and used for loops to derive it, if the int that is being read is greater or less than 127 then it sets the number accordingly with an if and else if, however, the code does run but does not print to the screen and I am not too sure if I am cout-ing the proper item or if I had to convert the ppm file back to a string in order to cout it. I did look into cplus.com to figure out if you are able to convert a int into a string, as well as trying to understand how it works. But I wasn't too sure if I've done it right. Moving beyond the technical side of the assignment, I did enjoy this milestone, mainly because I was able to work with the same code and kind of rearange it like a furnished home, but would have wished for a small extention due to the power outtage.
